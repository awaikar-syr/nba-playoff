I think you did a pretty nice job with this analysis.  I really appreciate the post-hoc inspection of feature importance.  I think you've slightly mis-interpreted the partial dependence plots, which most likely plot the influence of a variable over it's range.  So the interpretation of "age" here would be that the influence of age grows quickly from being a negative predictor to a positive predictor of playoffs.  Given this, you should really make sure you understand *why* you're getting this result - right now, your text interpretation of this feature sounds good, but doesn't align with the plot.

In general though, it looks to me like you set your data up correctly and did a solid job with the modeling and presentation.  I don't quite understand what role PCA played for you here, as you didn't use it in the final analysis.  I would have liked a somewhat deeper dive on prior literature and the variables that weighed more heavily. Could we do as well with just your top features?
